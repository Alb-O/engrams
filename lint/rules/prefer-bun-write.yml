severity: warning
message: "Prefer Bun.write() for file writing. It's up to 2x faster than fs.writeFile()."
note: |
  Bun.write() is up to 2x faster than fs.writeFile().
  
  Instead of:
    await fs.writeFile(path, content)
  
  Use:
    await Bun.write(path, content)
  
  Bun.write() also handles:
  - Objects (auto-serialized to JSON)
  - Blobs, ArrayBuffers, TypedArrays
  - Response objects (streaming)
  - Other Bun.file() instances (efficient copy)
rule:
  any:
    - pattern: fs.writeFile($PATH, $$$)
    - pattern: fsPromises.writeFile($PATH, $$$)
    - pattern: fs.promises.writeFile($PATH, $$$)
